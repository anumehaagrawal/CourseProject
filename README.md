# Introduction										
We have created a Google Chrome extension which shows useful information for the top 10 trending stocks day.  This chrome extension can be used to display the top trending stocks with some visualizations, the latest news headlines and how they affect the stock market and also information about specific stocks when a user visits the CNN finance page for that stock.

# Pre-requisites
1. Install git and clone the repository - https://github.com/anumehaagrawal/CourseProject
2. Install python3 and conda
3. Install the requirements - conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
4. Once nltk is installed,  run the following from a python console nltk.download('vader_lexicon')


# Installation Details
1.      After the repository is cloned, cd into the project directory > flask app and start the server using -> python3 server.py. The flask server is now up and running.
2.      On the chrome web browser, go to the extensions tab and click on Manage Extensions and turn on developer mode.
3.      On the right hand side there is an option called load unpacked and this will allow us to upload the project directory. 
The extension is now up and running!
